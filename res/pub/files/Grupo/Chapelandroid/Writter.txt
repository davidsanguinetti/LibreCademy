Ladies an Gentlemen, I present you with:

---What is Writter?
It is an app (backed by a web service and a storage server) to write and read stories, by users and for users.

---How does it work?
A user starts a story thread, with some options to fill or choose, such as "standard post length", 
"genre/s of the story" and some others yet to be established. Then any user can join the story with his own post
(according with the rules and requirements of said story) to continue it. These posts can be approved through
community and original poster (OP from now on) votes, and initially they are thought to be short posts 
(so they can be more easily written through the phone). And through the same method, posts which don't comply with
rules or just don't make the cut (quality or genre-wise) won't be posted permanently in the story.
The OP will have rights in his own story (ytbe too), but there will also be a "free" mode, where there are no tags
and the writters just write whatever they want to continue the story through the short posts.It will be
community-regulated, and there will also be awards, customizable profiles, achievements, events and contests.

---That's good, but where does money come in?
There will be two different kinds of users: Free and Subscriptors. Subscriptors will have to pay a monthly fee
(intended to be quite cheap) that will provide them of more options, such as "closed" stories in which the OP will
be the one to give permissions to join (that way only the users he likes will be able to take part in the story),
higher daily writing limit than free users (or just no limit), space to post their own stories for others to read,
access to critics (to both post and receive them), and not only that, they could also decide if they want support
to publish their stories, contact with editors, printers, etc... And many more functions!
And a good piece of news for all the free users: You can get free months of subscriptor user by inviting friends,
advertising us and winning writing contests and achievements!

Also, advertising will be playing a major part in all this, since magazines, book stores, publishers and many alike
will probably have interest in being advertised in our app+web. Furthermore, the contests and events we can organize
can be sponsored by some of them, offering prizes.

And to top all this, since it will be (mostly) an auto-regulated community, this platform can exist in any language
we might want, we'd just need to create the interface in that language and then the users will be the ones
writing, reading and doing the voting.

---So, what do we still need to decide?
Mostly which will be the free and subscriptor users features. How can we make the subscription be more appealing
without making the free users feel too restricted and useless.
We need a system that will work, be attractive to users and how can we focus this to gain the most interest possible.
Also, the main structure of the system, being how it will work in the end, with final numbers, perks and what
will we be offering the community, and how. This still need to be studied, and of course, we can still have some
good new ideas and rework a bit the concept.

So mainly, BRAINSTORMING!!!
